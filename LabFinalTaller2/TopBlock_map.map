Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   109 out of   2,278    4%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       128 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          349

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              76 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
